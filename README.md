# Robustr - Safely modify global state #
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jimhester/robustr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jimhester/robustr)

This package provides a series of methods which can be used to safely and
temporarily modify the state of global variables in R.

Many of these methods were originally a part of the devtools package.
Robustr was written to provide a simple package with limited dependencies which
would provide access to these functions.

Robustr also contains functions to call new R processes from within R.
